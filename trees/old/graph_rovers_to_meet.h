// Write code using commands below for two rovers to meet. Two rovers are dropped on Mars. Imagine Mars to be a straight infinite plane. When the rovers are dropped on Mars they are dropped with parachute. So their initial position on Mars is on parachute.
// Only commands possible to execute:
// 1. Go left
// 2. go right
// 3. NO OPERATION
// 3. If on parachute go to label.
// Label can be a piece of code with a name where we can transfer execution
// Using ONLY commands above write code for rovers to meet.
